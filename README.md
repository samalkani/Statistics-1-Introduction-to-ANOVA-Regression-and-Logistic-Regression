# Statistics-1-Introduction-to-ANOVA-Regression-and-Logistic-Regression

This repository is an introduction in the use of SAS/STAT software to perform statistical analyses. The focus is on t tests, ANOVA, and linear regression, and includes a brief introduction to logistic regression. 

## Overview

* Generate descriptive statistics and explore data with graphs.
* Perform analysis of variance and apply multiple comparison techniques.
* Perform linear regression and assess the assumptions.
* Use regression model selection techniques to aid in the choice of predictor variables in multiple regression.
* Use diagnostic statistics to assess statistical assumptions and identify potential outliers in multiple regression.
* Use chi-square statistics to detect associations among categorical variables.
* Fit a multiple logistic regression model.
* Score new data using developed models.
