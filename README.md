# Statistics-1-Introduction-to-ANOVA-Regression-and-Logistic-Regression

This repository is an introduction in the use of SAS/STAT software to perform statistical analyses. The focus is on t tests, ANOVA, and linear regression, and includes a brief introduction to logistic regression. 

## Overview

* Generate descriptive statistics and explore data with graphs.
* Perform analysis of variance and apply multiple comparison techniques.
* Perform linear regression and assess the assumptions.
* Use regression model selection techniques to aid in the choice of predictor variables in multiple regression.
* Use diagnostic statistics to assess statistical assumptions and identify potential outliers in multiple regression.
* Use chi-square statistics to detect associations among categorical variables.
* Fit a multiple logistic regression model.
* Score new data using developed models.

## Organisation of Repository

This repository is organised into 5 main folders as follows;

1. __SAS Demonstration Programs__ - a collection of short SAS programs to demonstrate basic concepts of statistics.
2. __SAS Solution Programs__ - a collection of short SAS programs that answer specific questions asked during the course.
3. __SAS Demonstration Program Output__ - a collection of SAS outputs that correspond to the SAS demonstration programs covered during the course.
4. __SAS Solution Program Output__ - a collection of SAS outputs that correspond to the SAS solution programs covered during the course.
5. __SAS Data Sets__ - a collection of data sets, stored formats, and stored scored data used by the SAS programs covered in this course.

## Labelling of the SAS Programs and corresponding SAS Output

The labelling of the SAS programs is very specific see examples below;

1. __st101d03__ = __st1__ = statistics 1 course, __01__ = Chapter of the course in this case chapter 1, __d__ = Demonstration program, __03__ = program number 3
2. __st101d03_Output__ = corresponding output of SAS program __st101d03__
3. __st101s02__ = __st1__ = statistics 1 course, __01__ = Chapter of the course in this case chapter 1, __s__ = Solution program, __03__ = program number 2
4. __st101s02__Output__ = corresponding output of the SAS program __st101s02__
